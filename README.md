# Web Dev 2 - Code Next Program

This project was created for Google's Code Next Program, specifically for the Web Dev 2 course. It contains four main example starter projects designed to inspire students and provide a foundation for their own projects. These examples are not fully built but are ready to be extended as part of the curriculum.

## Example Projects

1. **Linktree Clone** - A simple clone of the popular Linktree service.
2. **Slideshow Carousel** - An example of a slideshow carousel using Bootstrap.
3. **Media API Demo** - A demonstration of using the iTunes API to fetch and display media.
4. **Chatzapp** - A basic chat application using Parse for backend services.
